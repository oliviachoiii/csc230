; This skeleton of an assembly-language program is provided to help you
; begin with the programming task for A#1, part (a). In this and other
; files provided through the semester, you will see lines of code
; indicating "DO NOT TOUCH" sections. You are *not* to modify the
; lines within these sections. The only exceptions are for specific
; changes announced on conneX or in written permission from the course
; instructor. *** Unapproved changes could result in incorrect code
; execution during assignment evaluation, along with an assignment grade
; of zero. ****
;
; In a more positive vein, you are expected to place your code with the
; area marked "STUDENT CODE" sections.

;
; Your task: To compute the edit distance between two byte values,
; one in R16, the other in R17. If the first byte is:
;    0b10101111
; and the second byte is:
;    0b10011010
; then the edit distance -- that is, the number of corresponding
; bits whose values are not equal -- would be 4 (i.e., here bits 5, 4,
; 2 and 0 are different, where bit 0 is the least-significant bit).
; 
; Your solution must, of course, work for other values than those
; provided in the example above.
;
; In your code, store the computed edit distance value in R25.
;
; Your solution is free to modify the original values in R16
; and R17.
;
; ANY SIGNIFICANT IDEAS YOU FIND ON THE WEB THAT HAVE HELPED
; YOU DEVELOP YOUR SOLUTION MUST BE CITED AS A COMMENT (THAT
; IS, WHAT THE IDEA IS, PLUS THE URL).
